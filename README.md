## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I use this project to learn how to use SASS to style the webpage. To achieve this first i used VSCODE with **Live Sass Compiler** extension but then i decided to use PREPROS just to learn different ways to compile SASS.

Also i lear the nobr tag for words with hypens in the middle like "off-road".

```html
<nobr>off-road</nobr>
```

### Continued development

Even when i am satisfied whit the use of SASS i will continue practicing and applying different concepts like mixing and nesting to achieve a better handling of this tool.
